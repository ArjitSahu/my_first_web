            <h1 class="hello4">Cultural India</h1>
            <p class="hello4">The culture of India or Indian culture, sometimes equated to Indian civilization, is the
                heritage of
                social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and
                technologies that originated in or are associated with the Indian subcontinent. The term also applies
                beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration,
                colonization, or influence, particularly in Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music,
                architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.
                Indian culture, often labelled as an amalgamation of several cultures, has been influenced by a history
                that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization.[1][2] Many elements of
                Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and
                movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India and the world.

            <p class="hello4">Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing rapidly. The World
                Travel and
                Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹16.91 lakh crore (US$240 billion) or 9.2% of India's
                GDP in 2018 and supported 42.673 million jobs, 8.1% of its total employment.[1] The sector is predicted
                to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to ₹32.05 lakh crore (US$450 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP).[2] In
                October 2015, India's medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected
                to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020.[3] In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek
                medical treatment.[4]
                Over 10.04 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2017 compared to 8.89 million in 2016,
                representing a growth of 15.6%.[5][6][7] Domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories
                numbered 1,036.35 million in 2012, an increase of 16.5% from 2011.[8] In 2014, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra
                and Uttar Pradesh were the most popular states for tourists.[9] Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Agra and Jaipur
                were the five most visited cities of India by foreign tourists during the year 2015. Worldwide, Delhi is
                ranked 28th by the number of foreign tourist arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked 30th, Chennai 43rd, Agra
                45th, Jaipur 52nd and Kolkata 90th.[10]
